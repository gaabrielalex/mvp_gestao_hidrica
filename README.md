# 💧 Water Management MVP (Hackathon Project)

This is a minimal viable product (MVP) Flutter application for water management, designed for a quick hackathon pitch.  
It focuses on registering soil moisture readings for land plots ("talhões") and providing simple daily irrigation recommendations.

## ✨ Key Features (MVP)

- Register soil moisture readings per "talhão".  
- View a list of historical readings.  
- Generate daily irrigation recommendations based on moisture levels and simulated rain.  
- Offline-first with in-memory data storage (Hive or Isar integration planned).
